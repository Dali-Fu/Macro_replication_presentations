Warning: A .m file created by Dynare will have more than 32 nested parenthesis. MATLAB cannot support this. 
         We are going to modify, albeit inefficiently, this output to have fewer than 32 nested parenthesis. 
         It would hence behoove you to use the use_dll option of the model block to circumnavigate this problem.
         If you have not yet set up a compiler on your system, see the MATLAB documentation for doing so.
