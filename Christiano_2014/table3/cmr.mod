% One can estimate the baseline version of the model, 
% and versions of the model obtained by dropping none, one or several of the 
% four 'financial variables'. By dropping none of the variables, the user
% simply estimates the baseline model. The financial variables you want
% included in the estimation are in the following list:

@# define financial_data = ["networth_obs", "credit_obs", "premium_obs", "Spread1_obs"]

% Depending on the variables included in the financial data, we need some
% indicator variables.
