These are the files used to set up and solve the two baseline
macoreconomic models used in the paper, "The Sensitivity of Long-Term
Interest Rates to Economic News: Evidence and Implications for
Macroeconomic Models," by Refet Gurkaynak, Brian Sack, and Eric Swanson.

Files that begin with "cgg" are for the Clarida-Gali-Gertler model.
Files that begin with "r2k" are for the Rudebusch model.
Files that have the term "pistar" in them (e.g., "cggpistar.m") are for the
version of the model with a time-varying inflation target, pistar.

There are four Matlab programs (cgg.m, cggpistar.m, r2k.m, and
r2kpistar.m) which, when run, should reproduce all of the figures used in
the paper.  These programs were run in Matlab version 6 on a Sun Sparc
workstation running Solaris 2.9 (Solaris 9).

Note that, because these models are forward-looking, you need AIM (or
some other linear rational-expectations equation solver) to solve them.
We have included a version of AIM with these files in the subdirectory
"aim/".  However, the included version of the parser ("mdlez-aim") will
only run in Unix-type environments--to run the parser on a PC, you will
need to install either the Cygwin public domain utilities or go to the
Federal Reserve Board's public web site and download a PC-compatible
version of AIM.  If you are interested only in replicating the figures in
the paper, without altering the models at all, then you do not need the
parser, since we have included the parser output for each model (e.g.,
"cgg_aim_data.m" and "cgg_aim_matrices.m").

Parameter values in the models can be changed without re-parsing.  Just
modify the corresponding parameter values in the "cgg.m", "r2k.m",
etc. files.  Refer to the original model files ("cgg", "r2k", etc.) to
see how each parameter enters.

To make more significant modifications to the models, you must modify the
equations in the original model files, ("cgg", "cggpistar", "r2k", and
"rskpistar"), and then re-parse the files.
